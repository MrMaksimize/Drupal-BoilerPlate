##Drupal Boilerplate Make Files

A lot of this is based off [mikewink's](https://github.com/mikewink) work, especially his [drupal7-profile-dev](https://github.com/mikewink/drupal7-profile-dev) and [drupal-make-files](https://github.com/mikewink/drupal-make-files) repositories.  

This is a base set of make files that I plan to be using for future profiles and just when I'm spinning up a shiny drupal site.
