##Drupal Boilerplate Make Files

A lot of this is based off [mikewink's](https://github.com/mikewink) work, especially his [drupal7-profile-dev](https://github.com/mikewink/drupal7-profile-dev) and [drupal-make-files](https://github.com/mikewink/drupal-make-files) repositories.  

This is a base set of make files that I plan to be using for future profiles and just when I'm spinning up a shiny drupal site.

###The Plan
The idea is to use this repository as a boilerplate for future install profiles.  There are some things that absolutely need to be done within the installation hooks in order to make drupal simple to play with.  There are other things that can go off into features.  This is more like a shell, and the yolks will come soon.

Something to note: this profile doesn't try to be everything to everyone.  This is everything only for me, and the modules that I love and that I use constantly. This is the base drupal install for sites.
